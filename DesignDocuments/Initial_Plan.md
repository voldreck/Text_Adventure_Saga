### Text Adventure Saga, now with Java!

#### Goal:
To get good at writing code, you must write code.  The goal is to write a text adventure in Java as a manner of practicing both best programming practices, and solid design principles.  Additionally, I am going to start with a simple design, and once built and debugged, expand upon it.  I intend to do this a number of times to add new features and new design paradigms as necessary.  In some cases I may modify existing code, and in others I may do a complete rewrite from scratch.  I expect this to develop much further beyond the procedural text adventure that I wrote in C ages ago.

What follows are some ideas of how the first iteration might work:

### _Java Classes: OOP is as OOP does..._  
  

#### File: text_adv.sh

This is the 'starter', which contains only a shebang and one other line:
````
#!/bin/sh

java GameEngine
````

What's the point?  Starting the game from the command line with less typing.  That is all.

Br test:

end Br test.
begin space test:    
    
    
    
end space test.
